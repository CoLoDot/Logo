Geek logo suggestions:
- Play with fashion: by adding a beret, a foulard or new glasses
- Play with the hair by changing the haircut: How would the logo look like with a fringe, with a longer or a smaller haircut, or with different colours?

- Think of culture-related symbols such as visual arts and litterature

Text logo suggestions:
- adding an Eiffel Tower in the background
