# PyLadies Paris Logo

## Let's have some fun with creating a logo for Pyladies Paris !

we don't have a Pyladies Paris logo yet so let's create one together :-D

Want to get involved? You can either:
1. send us your ideas on our slack channel:, or
2. make a pull request here with your very own desing (in the end we will make a vote for which design to keep)

Global Pyladies have official logos:

1. geek logo:
<img src="https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-assets/blob/master/geek/png/pylady_geek_full_standard.png" width="200">

2. logo: 
<img src="https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-assets/blob/master/wordmark/png/pyladies_wordmark_standard_black.png" width="200">

You can use either (or both) of those logos as your base

Rules:

- you can change the color or add any extras
- you cannot change the size of the logo
- you can ask for anyone's opinion on a design or colour on Slack
- you can share as many designs as you'd like
- make sure that your logo is not offensive

you might also refer to: [global Pyladies repository](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-assets)

To join the Slack group, go to https://slackin.pyladies.com/ and then join the channel #city-paris and say hi!

We will vote for our favorite design. The design with the most votes will be used by the PyLadies Paris community as the new logo and the creator will be credited on the PyLadies.com website as well as on our social media channels.
