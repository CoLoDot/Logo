# Pyladies Paris Logo

## Let's have some fun with creating logo for Pyladies Paris !

Global Pyladies have official logos:

1. geek logo:
<img src="https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-assets/blob/master/geek/png/pylady_geek_full_standard.png" width="200">

2. logo: 

<img src="https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-assets/blob/master/wordmark/png/pyladies_wordmark_standard_black.png" width="200">

Based on either of those logos (or both) we would like to create Pyladies Paris logos.
If you have ideas please share them with us!

Rules:

- you can change the color or add any extras
- you cannot change the size of the logo
